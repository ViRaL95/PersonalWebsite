        The reason why I made this project was because I wanted to learn what went into temperature detectors and sensors inside integrated circuit chips and also because the schematic for this project was more challenging than the projects I had worked with previously. This project was completed during my internship at Coeo' Labs, a medical device company which built a device that reduced Ventilator Associated Pnuemonia

    One of my several mentors and I can be seen seen with a hairdryer heating up the 10k Thermistor. When the voltage across thermistor was high enough the output of the operational amplifier would become high which in turn would cause the Piezo Buzzer to release a sound
